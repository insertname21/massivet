      <p> Euthanasia is a difficult subject to consider, but our aim is to help support and provide dignified end of life care for your animal. With this in mind, we’ve put together helpful tips and resources for when it comes time to make the decision. 

</p>
        <h3>How Will You Know When the Time is Right?


</h3>
          <p>Although some euthenasia decisions are made as a result of an emergency, it is usually an elective decision based on a chronic decline in health, often associated with age. At Massie Mobile Veterinary Services, our primary concern is your animal’s overall quality of life. We have an outsider’s perspective that an owner, who sees their animal every day and may be less likely to notice gradual changes, may not have.  
</p>
<p>Therefore, it may be prudent to consider the following questions about your animal’s overall quality of care to determine if euthenasia is the best option for your animal’s wellbeing:
<ul>
<li>Can your animal move freely?</li>

<li>Are they suffering from chronic lameness?


</li>
<li>Are they being left behind or bullied by other animals?

</li>

<li>Do they seem happy or are they lethargic and depressed?



</li>

</ul> 
</p>
<p>If you had less than satisfactory answers to these answers, it may be time to consider euthenasia. We cannot make the decision for you, but we are more than willing to help you discuss your concerns and options when you call or text our practice at 541-636-1191.

<p><i>“Our beloved horse, Nugget, fell into an irrigation ditch and, being that she was 34 years old, did not have the strength to get herself out. After being with her for 8 hours, we called Andria and Keaton and they were there within the hour. They were very compassionate and understanding of what we were going through. They told us we had given her a wonderful life and after taking her vitals, they concurred that it was her time to go to "pet heaven". I really appreciate Andria and Keaton's hugs and kind words.These two make a great team and I highly recommend them.”</i></p>

<h3>If you choose to go forward with euthenasia, here’s what you can expect from the experience:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our sole method of euthenasia is through lethal injection, where your animal will be given an overdose of an anesthetic drug that ultimately stops their heart. A sedative may be given first so that your animal does not become distressed when it begins to feel sleepy and a catheter will be placed into a vein to ensure all the drug is administered smoothly. 
</li>

<li>Your animal may exhibit reflexes during and after their passing; this is normal and a sign of their muscles relaxing. Your animal is not able to feel this happening, but it may be distressing for owners if they are unprepared.

</li>
<li>We will charge for the visit, the euthenasia itself, and the drugs we administer. We will require you or someone on your behalf to sign a consent form prior to the operation.


</li>



</ul> 
<p>Most people choose to have their animal euthanized at home or in their yard so that they are in familiar surroundings and relaxed. For large animals, it is crucial that the site have vehicular access, as the body will need to be removed post-operation.
</p>
<p>Some owners find watching the euthanasia of their animal helps provide closure for them, while others prefer to remember their animal as they were and find watching distressing. If you are able to be calm and relaxed during the procedure, then your presence may be reassuring for your animal, while the opposite is also true. However, there is no right or wrong answer on whether you should be present for the event; Massie Mobile Veterinary Services are experts at handling this sensitive task and assure that your animal’s last moments will be peaceful. We will require you or someone on your behalf to sign a consent form. 
</p>
<p>If two animals are particularly closely bonded, it may be more beneficial for their counterpart to be separated during the operation. If necessary, their companion may need to be sedated to avoid them becoming agitated. In the case of horses, it can also be helpful to let the bonded horse or pony see their euthanized companion and let them sniff or graze nearby until they stop showing an interest. This can stop the companion from calling for their partner. 
</p>
<p>In any case, it is important to consider what you will do and plan ahead so you are able to cope with any eventuality. We urge you to remember that your horse depends on you to make rational, informed decisions, often in difficult circumstances and you must ensure that the horse’s welfare is always put first. 
</p>

<p>World Horse Welfare have produced a useful guide as well as an Owner’s Plan to help you prepare in advance.

</p>
<h3>What Can You Expect After the Procedure?
</h3>
<p><h4>Post Mortem</h4>In some cases we may ask if you wish for a post mortem to be carried out. Post mortems can help determine the cause of death if your animal died unexpectedly. In some situations, insurance companies may insist on a post mortem before a mortality claim is paid out. Please be clear on exactly what your policy covers if euthenasia is required. If insured for loss of use and a claim is going to be made, the insurance company must be notified in advance. With the exception of an emergency situation, the permission of the insurers is needed otherwise the claim may be invalidated.
</p>
<p><h4>Cremation
</h4>Please note that we do not currently offer any cremation services for large animals. However, we do recommend a large animal removal service located in Southern Oregon for extraction purposes, should you need them. 

</p>
<h4>Bereavement and Support Services:
</h4><p>Please feel free to ask us any question, no matter how trivial you think it might be, at any stage during this difficult process. We want to make sure you are as fully informed as possible about every aspect of euthanasia and feel empowered to begin your healing journey post-operation.
</p>
<p>If you are currently struggling with a recent bereavement, then there are bereavement services which are available for help, support and guidance, including: </p>

PETCLOUD - 1-833-PET-12341</p>
